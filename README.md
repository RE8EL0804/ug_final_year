## Anomaly Detection in IoT Network using Reinforcement Learning
Internet of Things (IoT) networks consist of a multitude of interconnected devices and sensors that collect and exchange data autonomously. These networks are susceptible to various security threats, including anomalies and malicious activities. Anomaly detection in IoT networks is crucial to ensure the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data and devices.Using reinforcement learning techniques to identify abnormal behaviors or potential security breaches in an IoT network.
The main objective of this project is to develop an efficient and adaptive anomaly detection system using reinforcement learning techniques for an IoT network. Anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the security and reliability of IoT networks, as they often involve a vast number of interconnected devices with diverse data patterns and behaviors.
